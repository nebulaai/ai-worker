   ```json
      {
         "ledger": "http://54.211.127.67:8080",
         "node": "http://18.215.32.172:8051",
         "wallet": "0xeF980D9ACB9Bd396b38b0A0A5de834d70A9b9125",
         "price_limit": "1",

      Please make sure you have the **private key** of this wallet for future usage.
      
   3. "price_limit" is recommended to keep as default.
   
   4. "dual_mode" controls 'mining when idle' functionality.
   
      * When true, worker will mine NBAI when waiting for a task.
      * When false, worker will not mine NBAI when waiting for a task.
